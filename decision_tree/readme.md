This exercise is to predict whether you will have a good night-out in Jerusalem for the coming New Year's Eve. 
Assume that you have kept a record of your previous night-outs with the following attributes.
• How densely the place is usually occupied {High, Moderate, Low}
• How the prices are {Expensive, Normal, Cheap}
• Volume of the music {Loud, Quiet}
• The location {Talpiot, City-Center, Mahane-Yehuda, Ein-Karem, German-Colony}
• Whether you are a frequent customer (VIP) {Yes, No}
• Whether this place has your favorite beer {Yes, No}
• Whether you enjoyed {Yes, No}

In this project, instead of using numpy and one hot encoder technique, pandas.DataFrame is used for the data format. 
The word form category can be directly analyzed without transfer to numerical category.

The GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model) algorithm implementation.

The input data (clusters.txt) contain 150 2d data points with x and y position.

In this project, the 150 data points are seperated to different clusters.

The visualization of data points and corresponding clusters is also implemented in plot function.

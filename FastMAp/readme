In FastMap class, there are five main functions: dis_cal, project_dis_cal, Farest_pair, fastmap, and plot_2d.

Note that in dis_cal function, the distance between two points for all points are not calculated once, instead,

it substrate the distance between all saved points (xi and xj) in previous iteration when dis_cal function is called.

This implementation may not be necessary in this assignment since there are only ten objects.

However, it will save time when the object number increase because calculating all distance between two points is O(n^2).
